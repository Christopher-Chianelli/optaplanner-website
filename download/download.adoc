** link:releaseNotes/releaseNotes#{site.pom.latestFinal.releaseNotesVersion}.html[Release notes #{site.pom.latestFinal.releaseNotesVersion}]

** Release date: `#{site.pom.latestFinal.releaseDate}`
** Download size: Large (over 90% is due to examples, data sets and documentation)

* Red Hat subscription releases: Check https://access.redhat.com/downloads[the product download site].

=== Maven, Gradle, Ivy or Buildr

The OptaPlanner jars are also available in http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|org.optaplanner[the central maven repository]
(and also in https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/index.html#nexus-search;gav\~org.optaplanner\~\~\~\~[the JBoss maven repository]).

If you use Maven, just add a dependency in your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>
      <artifactId>optaplanner-core</artifactId>
      <version>#{site.pom.latestFinal.version}</version>
    </dependency>
----

This is similar for Gradle, Ivy and Buildr.

[[NonFinalReleases]]
== Non-Final releases

*Non-Final releases are the best way to test drive new features and API's
to provide feedback before we lock down the API with a Final release.*
We welcome that feedback on the link:../community/forum.html[forum], link:../community/chat.html[chat]
or link:../code/issueTracker.html[issue tracker].

[[AlphasBetasCRs]]
=== Alpha's, Beta's and CR's

An Alpha can be unstable.
A Beta should work (it passes automated testing), but its new API's might still change in the next release.
A CR should be almost identical to the Final release.
