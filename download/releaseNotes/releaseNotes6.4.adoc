== New and noteworthy

=== Statistical benchmarking

Statistical benchmarking allows you to rerun your single benchmarks multiple times.
This can be useful to eliminate influences of the environment and verify the results of your benchmarks.

The report visualizes the results of the runs in the "Best score" table,
and also compares the results of sub single benchmarks for each problem benchmark in a box plot chart:

To enable it, add the following line with a positive integer as a parameter to your `<inheritedSolverBenchmark>`
or to individual `<solverBenchmark>` elements.

<inheritedSolverBenchmark>
  <name>...</name>
  <solver>
    ...
  </solver>
  <subSingleCount>N</subSingleCount>
</inheritedSolverBenchmark>

=== Other improvements

* Benchmark warm ups now run in parallel threads, just like the actual benchmarks.
* Apache Camel's camel-optaplanner 2.16 supports async solving, daemon mode and ProblemFactChange processing. Contributed by Bilgin Ibryam.
* A `SolverFactory` can now be cloned with `cloneSolverFactory()` to concurrently configure it dynamically per user request without parsing the solver config XML each time.
* Examples application has switched to a more modern look and feel.
* Several design patterns to deal with scheduling in time have been documented in the manual.
* Various bugs resolved. See https://issues.jboss.org/projects/PLANNER?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:release-page&status=released[our issue tracker].
