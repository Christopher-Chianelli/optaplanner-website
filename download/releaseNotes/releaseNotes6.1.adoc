== OptaPlanner 6.1 (currently still Beta)

We are happy to announce a 6.1 Beta release of OptaPlanner.

OptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine written in Javaâ„¢
to solve constraint satisfaction problems efficiently.
Together with the Drools rule engine and the jBPM workflow engine,
it is a strong and flexible foundation for knowledge management.
