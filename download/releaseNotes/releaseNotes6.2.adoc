== OptaPlanner 6.2 (currently still Beta)

We are happy to announce a 6.2 Beta release of OptaPlanner.

OptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine written in Java™
to solve constraint satisfaction problems efficiently. +
Together with the Drools rule engine and the jBPM workflow engine,
it is a strong and flexible foundation for knowledge management.

=== Status

OptaPlanner is:

* *Stable*: Heavily tested with unit, integration and stress tests.
* *Reliable*: Used across the world. See link:../../learn/testimonialsAndCaseStudies.html[case studies].
* *Scalable*: One of the examples handles 50 000 entities with 5 000 variables each, multiple constraint types and billions of possible constraint matches.
* *Documented*: See link:../../learn/documentation.html[the detailed reference manual] or one of the many examples.
* *Open source*: Released under link:../../code/license.html[the Apache Software License].

=== New and noteworthy

==== Strategic Oscillation Tabu Search

Strategic Oscillation Tabu Search is often an improvement over normal Tabu Search.
Instead of picking the accepted move with the highest score, it employs a different mechanism:
If there's an improving move, it picks it. If there's no improving move however,
it prefers moves which improve a softer score level, over moves which break a harder score level less.

To enable it, do this:

[source,xml]
----
  <localSearch>
    ...
    <acceptor>
      <entityTabuSize>7</entityTabuSize>
    </acceptor>
    <forager>
      <acceptedCountLimit>1000</acceptedCountLimit>
      <finalistPodiumType>STRATEGIC_OSCILLATION</finalistPodiumType>
    </forager>
  </localSearch>

==== New example: Cheap time scheduling

Schedule all tasks in time and on a machine to minimize the power cost.
Each machine must have enough hardware to run all of its tasks.
Each task and machine consumes power. The power price differs over time.

==== New benchmarker statistics: Constraint Match Total Best/Step score

These new statistics visualize how the individual constraint types change over time.

==== Other improvements

* Construction Heuristics: new pick early type: +FIRST_FEASIBLE_SCORE+ which is useful for scaling.
