== OptaPlanner 6.2 announcement

We are happy to announce the 6.2 release of OptaPlanner.

OptaPlanner is a lightweight, embeddable planning engine written in Java™
to solve constraint satisfaction problems efficiently. +
Together with the Drools rule engine and the jBPM workflow engine,
it is a strong and flexible foundation for knowledge management.

== Status

OptaPlanner is:

* *Stable*: Heavily tested with unit, integration and stress tests.
* *Reliable*: Used across the world. See link:../../learn/testimonialsAndCaseStudies.html[case studies].
* *Scalable*: One of the examples handles `50 000` entities with `5 000` variables each, multiple constraint types and billions of possible constraint matches.
* *Documented*: Read link:../../learn/documentation.html[the detailed reference manual] or one of the many examples.
* *Open source*: Released under link:../../code/license.html[the Apache Software License].

== New and noteworthy

=== Scalable VRP with nearby selection

Nearby selection allows a vehicle routing problem to scale out gracefully beyond 1000 locations,
without the need for partitioning.
It works by focusing on move selections that modify locations that are near each other:

image:6.2/nearbySelectionRandomDistribution.png[Nearby selection random distribution]

It results in much better scalability on larger datasets, for example a VRP with 2750 customers
(higher is better), which reduces fuel and labor expenses by `15%` in a 5 minute run:

Several nearby selection probability distributions are supported:
block distribution, linear distribution, parabolic distribution and beta distribution.

=== TailChainSwapMove (2-opt) for VRP

TailChainSwapMove is a new move type for chained variables.
It's a subset of SubchainChangeMove and SubchainSwapMove, but it's generally more efficient,
especially for time windowed cases.

In our benchmarks, a union of ChangeMove, SwapMove and TailChainSwapMove (using nearby selection on all 3)
performed best.

=== Improved build-in variable listener efficiency

VRP with a `@InverseRelationShadowVariable` is now more efficient. In some cases, it's up to *`32%` faster*.

=== Strategic Oscillation Tabu Search

Strategic Oscillation Tabu Search is often an improvement over normal Tabu Search.
Instead of picking the accepted move with the highest score, it employs a different mechanism:
If there's an improving move, it picks it. If there's no improving move however,
it prefers moves which improve a softer score level, over moves which break a harder score level less.

To enable it, do this:

[source,xml]
----
  <localSearch>
    ...
    <acceptor>
      <entityTabuSize>7</entityTabuSize>
    </acceptor>
    <forager>
      <acceptedCountLimit>1000</acceptedCountLimit>
      <finalistPodiumType>STRATEGIC_OSCILLATION</finalistPodiumType>
    </forager>
  </localSearch>

=== New example: Cheap time scheduling

Schedule all tasks in time and on a machine to minimize the power cost.
Each machine must have enough hardware to run all of its tasks.
Each task and machine consumes power. The power price differs over time.

Based on contributions by Lukáš Petrovický.

=== New benchmarker statistics: Constraint Match Total Best/Step score

These new statistics visualize how the individual constraint types change over time.

This gives a better insight as to which constraints impact the score the most.

=== Other improvements

* Construction Heuristics: new pick early type: `FIRST_FEASIBLE_SCORE` which is useful for scaling.
* Benchmarker: logarithmic scale for Problem scale axis when appropriate. Contributed by Ondrej Skopek.
* BendableLongScore: Bendable score with long types. Contributed by Dieter De Paepe.
