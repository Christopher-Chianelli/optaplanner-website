=== Benchmark a solver configuration quickly

*There isn't a valid excuse any more to not use the benchmarker.*
You can now run it in just a few lines of java code (no XML code):

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
    SolverFactory<TennisSolution> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(...);
    // Set up the benchmarkFactory in 1 line (no XML)
    PlannerBenchmarkFactory benchmarkFactory = PlannerBenchmarkFactory.createFromSolverFactory(
            solverFactory);

    // Fetch or generate your input problem(s)
    TennisSolution problem1 = generateProblem1();
    TennisSolution problem2 = generateProblem2();
    ...
    // Run the benchmark
    PlannerBenchmark plannerBenchmark = benchmarkFactory.buildPlannerBenchmark(problem1, problem2, ...);
    plannerBenchmark.benchmark();
----

This builds and runs a vanilla benchmark
that gives insight in the performance and scalability of your implementation.
To get more insight, switch to the XML configuration.
