[[NewAndNoteWorthy]]
== New and noteworthy

=== Java 8 or higher

OptaPlanner 7.x now requires Java 8 or higher to run. The 6.x releases remain compatible with Java 6 or higher.

The API and implementation now make use of Java 7 and Java 8 features (such as lamdba's).


=== Multi-threaded partitioned search

OptaPlanner now has out of the box support for solving a single dataset by partitioning across multiple threads.
So it makes use of multiple CPU cores for a single problem.

Partitioned Search can implement geo-fencing for Vehicle Routing use cases.
For example, we can split up Great Britain into 4 parts and solve those parts separately:

image:7.0/partitionedSearchThreading.png[Partitioned Search Threading]

This can potentially http://www.optaplanner.org/blog/2014/03/03/CanMapReduceSolvePlanningProblems.html[reduce solution quality],
but for big datasets (usually above 5000 entities) the performance gains normally outweighs the long-term quality loss,
because when a result is needed within hours or less, the solution quality is still higher.

Especially for Construction Heuristics, it can deliver an initial, feasible solution in a fraction of the time.
For example, *we've benchmarked a 30 time speed increase by partitioning Construction Heuristics in 4 parts
running on 4 CPU cores*, on an 8 core machine for a dataset with 4800 entities and 1200 planning values.
This speeds is attributed not just to the utilization of more CPU cores (at most a times 4 increase),
but mainly to the problem search space size reduction per part thread.

Partitioned Search is configured like any other solver phase:

[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<solver>
  ...
  <partitionedSearch>
    <!-- The SolutionParititioner splits a dataset into parts -->
    <solutionPartitionerClass>org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.optional.partitioner.CloudBalancePartitioner</solutionPartitionerClass>

    <!-- Optionally configure which phaes to run on each part -->
    <constructionHeuristic>...</constructionHeuristic>
    <localSearch>...</localSearch>
  </partitionedSearch>
</solver>
----

There is support to limit the number CPU cores OptaPlanner consumes (to avoid CPU starving other processes and thread)
through `runnablePartThreadLimit`. Furthermore, it is also possible to configure a `threadFactoryClass`.

For now, you still need to implement the `SolutionPartitioner` interface,
but we'll add out of the box strategies (such as geo-fencing) soon:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
public interface SolutionPartitioner<Solution_> {

    List<Solution_> splitWorkingSolution(ScoreDirector<Solution_> scoreDirector);

}
----



=== No longer needed to implement the `Solution` interface

Your solution class no longer needs both have the `@PlanningSolution` annotation and implement the `Solution` interface.
No need to repeat yourself any more.
The `Solution` interface is now deprecated (but still works for backwards compatibility):
only the `@PlanningSolution` annotation suffices.

Instead of implementing the old interface methods, annotate your `Score` getter with `@PlanningScore`.
If you're using Drools score calculation, annotate all problem fact getters (or fields)
with `@ProblemFactCollectionProperty` or `@ProblemFactProperty`.

[source, java]
----
@PlanningSolution
public class CloudBalance {

    private List<CloudComputer> computerList;
    ...

    private HardSoftScore score;

    @ValueRangeProvider(id = "computerRange")
    @ProblemFactCollectionProperty
    public List<CloudComputer> getComputerList() {...}

    @PlanningScore
    public HardSoftScore getScore() {...}
    public void setScore(HardSoftScore score) {...}

}
----

Solving hasn't changed:

[source,java]
----
    SolverFactory<CloudBalance> solverFactory = SolverFactory.createFromXmlResource(...);
    Solver<CloudBalance> solver = solverFactory.buildSolver();
    CloudBalance solvedCloudBalance = solver.solve(unsolvedCloudBalance);
----

=== No longer needed to define the score type in the solver configuration

Planner now picks it up automatically from the domain model.


=== New JAXB and Jackson support and improved XStream support

To marshall a `Score` from or to XML or JSON, use the appropriate binder
for XStream, JAXB or Jackson in `optaplanner-persistence-xstream`, `optaplanner-persistence-jaxb` and `optaplanner-persistence-jackson`.

These will create pretty XML:

[source,xml]
----
<CloudBalance>
   ...
   <score>0hard/-200soft</score>
</CloudBalance>
----

And beautiful JSON:

[source,json]
----
{
   ...
   "score":"0hard/-200soft"
}
----

See the documentation on how to configure them.


=== New module `optaplanner-test` with JUnit testing support

To test each score rule individually, to assure it does what the business expects it to do,
use the new `ScoreVerifier` support classes in `optaplanner-test`.


=== New example: Task assigning

Assign tasks to employee and take into account required skills, affinity with the customer and task priority.
This example also demonstrates real-time producing and consuming of tasks.

=== Other improvements

* Booleans are now supported by `ValueRangeFactory` too: `createBooleanValueRange()`
* Dates and time are now supported by `ValueRangeFactory` too: `createTemporalValueRange()`. Contributed by Kevin Wallis.
* `@ValueRangeProvider` now supports methods that return an array too.
* The log now outputs the score calculation speed for each solver phase too.
* The documentation is now in AsciiDoc, which improves output quality and makes it easier to contribute.
