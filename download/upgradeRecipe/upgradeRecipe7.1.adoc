=== `<valueSelector>`: `variableName` is now an attribute

When power tweaking move selectors, such as `<changeMoveSelector>`,
in a use case with multiple planning variables,
the `<variableName>` XML element has been replaced by a `variableName="..."` XML attribute.
This reduces the solver configuration verbosity.
For backwards compatibility, the old way is still supported in the 7.x series.

Before in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
  <valueSelector>
    <variableName>room</variableName>
  </valueSelector>
----

After in `*SolverConfig.xml` and `*BenchmarkConfig.xml`:
[source, xml]
----
  <valueSelector variableName="room"/>
----
