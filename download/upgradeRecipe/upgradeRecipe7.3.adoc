=== `SolutionFileIO`: `getOutputFileExtension()` is now defaulted

It's no longer needed to implement `getOutputFileExtension()` of the `SolutionFileIO` interface
if it returns the same as `getInputFileExtension()`.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, xml]
----
public class VehicleRoutingFileIO implements SolutionFileIO<VehicleRoutingSolution> {

    @Override
    public String getInputFileExtension() {
        return "vrp";
    }

    @Override
    public String getOutputFileExtension() {
        return "vrp";
    }

    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, xml]
----
public class VehicleRoutingFileIO implements SolutionFileIO<VehicleRoutingSolution> {

    @Override
    public String getInputFileExtension() {
        return "vrp";
    }

    ...
}
----
