=== `movableEntitySelectionFilter` is now inherited

An entity's `movableEntitySelectionFilter` is now inherited by child entities.
The workaround of configuring the filter twice, is now obsolete.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningEntity(movableEntitySelectionFilter = ParentFilter.class)
public class Animal {
   ...
}

@PlanningEntity(movableEntitySelectionFilter = ParentFilter.class)
public class Dog extends Animal {
   ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@PlanningEntity(movableEntitySelectionFilter = ParentFilter.class)
public class Animal {
   ...
}

@PlanningEntity()
public class Dog extends Animal {
   ...
}
----
