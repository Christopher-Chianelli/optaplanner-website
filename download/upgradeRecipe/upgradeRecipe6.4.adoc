== From 6.3.0.Final to 6.4.0.Beta1

====
If you have a custom `ScoreDefinition`: that interface has new method `getLevelLabels()`.
`AbstractScoreDefinition` and `AbstractFeasibilityScoreDefinition` now expect those `levelLabels` as a constructor parameter.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
public class HardSoftScoreDefinition extends AbstractFeasibilityScoreDefinition<HardSoftScore> {
    public HardSoftScoreDefinition() {}
    public int getLevelsSize() {
        return 2;
    }
    ...
}
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
public class HardSoftScoreDefinition extends AbstractFeasibilityScoreDefinition<HardSoftScore> {
    public HardSoftScoreDefinition() {
        super(new String[]{"hard score", "soft score"});
    }
    ...
}

If you're using `SolutionFileIO`: that class has been moved from the `optaplanner-benchmark` jar to `optaplanner-persistence-common` jar.

After in `pom.xml`:

  <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>
  <artifactId>optaplanner-persistence-common</artifactId>

If you're using `XStreamScoreConverter`: that class has been moved from the `optaplanner-benchmark` jar to `optaplanner-persistence-xstream` jar.

After in `pom.xml`:

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.optaplanner</groupId>

If you're using `BendableScore` and XStream: `XStreamBendableScoreConverter` (which only supported `BendableScore`) has been deleted.
The generic `XStreamScoreConverter` now supports `BendableScore`, `BendableLongScore` and `BendableBigDecimalScore` too.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@XStreamConverter(value = XStreamBendableScoreConverter.class, ints = {1, 2})
private BendableScore score;
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
@XStreamConverter(value = XStreamScoreConverter.class, types = {BendableScoreDefinition.class}, ints = {1, 2})
private BendableScore score;
----

If you have a custom `ScoreDefinition`: that interface has another new method `fromLevelNumbers()`.
It does the opposite of `Score.toLevelNumbers()`.

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
public class HardSoftScoreDefinition extends AbstractFeasibilityScoreDefinition<HardSoftScore> {
    ...
    @Override
    public HardSoftScore fromLevelNumbers(Number[] levelNumbers) {
        if (levelNumbers.length != getLevelsSize()) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("The levelNumbers (" + Arrays.toString(levelNumbers)
                    + ")'s length (" + levelNumbers.length + ") must equal the levelSize (" + getLevelsSize() + ").");
        }
        return HardSoftScore.valueOf((Integer) levelNumbers[0], (Integer) levelNumbers[1]);
    }
}

If you're using JPA-Hibernate with OptaPlanner, you'll want to take advantage of the new module `optaplanner-persistence-jpa`.
See docs chapter "Integration" for more information.

If you're using `SingleBenchmarkResult`: the functionality of the method `getScore()` and `getUninitializedVariableCount()` has moved to
`getAverageScore()` and `getAverageUninitializedVariableCount()` because of the addition of `SubSingleBenchmarkResult` (Statistical benchmarking).

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
singleBenchmarkResult.getScore();
singleBenchmarkResult.getUninitializedVariableCount();
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
singleBenchmarkResult.getAverageScore();
singleBenchmarkResult.getAverageUninitializedVariableCount();
----

=== icon:user-secret[] Implementation detail

[.hidden-section]
====
If you're using `SingleStatistic` or any of it's subclasses: all of them were renamed to include "Sub" as a part of
Statistical benchmarking. The package `org.optaplanner.benchmark.impl.statistic.single` was also renamed to
`org.optaplanner.benchmark.impl.statistic.subsingle`. `SingleStatisticType` has not been changed, therefore no changes
in the configuration are needed.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
import org.optaplanner.benchmark.impl.statistic.single.*;
*SingleStatistic singleStatistic;
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
import org.optaplanner.benchmark.impl.statistic.subsingle.*;
*SubSingleStatistic subSingleStatistic;

If you're configuring the `SolverFactory` dynamically for each user request with differ settings,
use `SolverFactory.cloneSolverFactory()` to avoid a race condition.

====
The method `TerminationConfig.clone()` has been removed.
The `inherit()` method now guarantees that afterwards changing the child or parent will not affect the other.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
TerminationConfig clone = terminationConfig.clone();
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
TerminationConfig clone = new TerminationConfig();
clone.inherit(terminationConfig);
