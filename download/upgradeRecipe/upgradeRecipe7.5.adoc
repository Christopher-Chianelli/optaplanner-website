=== `Indictment`: natural comparison changed

An `Indictment` is now naturally sorted by its justification.
To sort it based on its score, use `IndictmentScoreTotalComparator`.

Before in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
Collections.sort(indictmentList);
----

After in `*.java`:
[source, java]
----
Collections.sort(indictmentList, new IndictmentScoreTotalComparator());
----
