== What is OptaPlanner?

OptaPlanner is the leading Open Source Java™ constraint solver
to optimize assigning tasks to employees,
adhering to skill, affinity and other constraints.

OptaPlanner is *a lightweight, embeddable planning engine*.
It works with your domain classes and your custom constraints (which can reuse existing code).
There's no need to input difficult mathematical equations.
Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated optimization heuristics and metaheuristics
(such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) with very efficient score calculation.

OptaPlanner is *open source software*, released under link:../../code/license.html[the Apache Software License].
It is written in 100% pure Java™, runs on any JVM and is available in link:../../download/download.html[the Maven Central repository] too.
