== What is OptaPlanner's ConferenceSchedulingApp?

The `ConferenceSchedulingApp` assigns conference talks to timeslots and rooms,
while adhering to 30+ constraints, such as speaker availability, content conflicts, language diversity and many more.
It can read the list of speakers, rooms, timeslots and talks from an Excel file
or from the devoxx-cfp REST API. Internally, it uses plain old Java™ domain objects:

`ConferenceSchedulingApp` is open source (Apache License) software,
because it's part of `optaplanner-examples`.
To try it, click the green button to download it and then run the examples.

== What is OptaPlanner?

OptaPlanner is the leading Open Source Java™ constraint solver
to optimize assigning conference talks to timeslots and rooms,
adhering to availability, capacity and other constraints.

OptaPlanner is *a lightweight, embeddable planning engine*.
It works with your domain classes and your custom constraints (which can reuse existing code).
There's no need to input difficult mathematical equations.
Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated optimization heuristics and metaheuristics
(such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) with very efficient score calculation.

OptaPlanner is *open source software*, released under link:../../code/license.html[the Apache Software License].
It is written in 100% pure Java™, runs on any JVM and is available in link:../../download/download.html[the Maven Central repository] too.
