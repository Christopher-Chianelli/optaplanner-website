== What is OptaPlanner's ConferenceSchedulingApp?

The `ConferenceSchedulingApp` assigns conference talks to timeslots and rooms,
while adhering to 30+ constraints, such as speaker availability, content conflicts, language diversity and many more.
It can read the list of speakers, rooms, timeslots and talks from an Excel file
or from the devoxx-cfp REST API. Internally, it uses plain old Java™ domain objects:

`ConferenceSchedulingApp` is open source (Apache License) software,
because it's part of `optaplanner-examples`.

== What is OptaPlanner?

OptaPlanner is the leading Open Source Java™ constraint solver
to optimize business resource planning use cases,
such as link:vehicleRoutingProblem.html[Vehicle Routing],
link:employeeRostering.html[Employee Rostering],
link:cloudOptimization.html[Cloud Optimization],
link:taskAssignmentOptimization.html[Task Assignment],
link:conferenceScheduling.html[Conference Scheduling],
Job Scheduling, Bin Packing
and link:[many more].
Every organization faces such scheduling puzzles:
assign a limited set of _constrained_ resources (employees, assets, time and money)
to provide products or services.
OptaPlanner delivers more efficient plans to improve service quality and reduce costs.

OptaPlanner is *a lightweight, embeddable planning engine*.
It enables normal Java™ programmers to solve optimization problems efficiently.
It is also compatible with other JVM languages (such as Kotlin and Scala).
Constraints apply on plain domain objects and can reuse existing code.
There's no need to input them as mathematical equations.
Under the hood, OptaPlanner combines sophisticated optimization heuristics and metaheuristics
(such as Tabu Search, Simulated Annealing and Late Acceptance) with very efficient score calculation.

OptaPlanner is *open source software*, released under link:code/license.html[the Apache Software License].
It is written in 100% pure Java™, runs on any JVM and is available in link:download/download.html[the Maven Central repository] too.
