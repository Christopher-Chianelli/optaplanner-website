OptaPlanner is a good base for metaheuristics research. Read about some of the advantages in

Especially https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpcPEieU3Cg[OptaPlanner Benchmarker] and our big set of already implemented use cases,
make it easy to test your new algorithm objectively against the existing algorithms.
