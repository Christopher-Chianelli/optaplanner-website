== How to build with Awestruct

=== On Fedora 24

Follow these instructions:

```
$ sudo dnf install ruby
$ ruby --version
ruby 2.3.1p112 (2016-04-26 revision 54768) [x86_64-linux]

$ sudo dnf install rubygem-rake

# This won't immediately work
$ rake setup

# rake setup: Using the bundler fails, this fixes it:
$ sudo dnf install rubygem-bundler

# rake setup: Installing the gem ffi fails, this fixes it:
$ sudo dnf install ruby-devel rpm-build

# rake setup: Installing the gem eventmachine fails, this fixes it:
$ sudo dnf install gcc-c++

# Now it works
$ rake setup
```

Then build the optaplanner-website (before and after your changes):

```
$ rake clean build
$ firefox _site/index.html
```

And publish your changes (if you got authorization):

```
$ rake clean build publish
```

=== On other systems

Follow the instructions of Awestruct's http://awestruct.org/getting_started/[getting started guide].
