http://www.optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner] 6.2 has made big step forward for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP),
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and similar use cases.
A new feature, called *Nearby Selection, enables it to scale to bigger problems much more efficiently*
without sacrificing potential optimal solutions (which is common for inferior techniques such as partitioning).

== Opposite ends of the map

== Partitioning, Geo-fencing, etc

== Nearby Selection
