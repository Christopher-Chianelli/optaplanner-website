So we solved the planning problem and found a best solution which has a score of `0hard/-123soft`.
Why `-123soft`? Where does that penalty come from? Which constraints are broken?
Let's see how we can break down the score and visualize the pain points in the schedule to the user.

We can approach this problem from two sides, on a course schedule use case:

== Break down score per constraint type

In the top-down approach, we split up the score per constraint type (so per score rule):

|===
|Constraint type |Score impact

|Room capacity >|`-100soft`
|Room stability >|`-40soft`
|Curriculum compactness >|`-3soft`
h|Total >h|`-123soft`
|===

The _room capacity_ constraint is broken the most: it causes for `81%` (`100/123`) of the score loss.
Maybe it's time to build more classrooms?

== Heat map with score impact per planning entity

In the bottom-up approach, we visualize the score impact per lecture.
The more it impacts the score, the more orange in the heat map:

|===
|Solution |Normal view |Indictment heat map | Score

|Initialized a|image::courseScheduling0Initialized.png[] a|image::courseScheduling0IndictmentInitialized.png[] |`-4hard/-18soft`
|Feasible a|image::courseScheduling1Feasible.png[] a|image::courseScheduling1IndictmentFeasible.png[] |`0hard/-68soft`
|Near optimal a|image::courseScheduling2NearOptimal.png[] a|image::courseScheduling2IndictmentNearOptimal.png[] |`0hard/-1soft` (*)
|Optimal a|image::courseScheduling3Optimal.png[] a|image::courseScheduling3IndictmentOptimal.png[] |`0hard/0soft`
|===

As OptaPlanner find better and better solutions, there is less orange on the heat map.

(*) Notice that `-1soft` can be shared by multiple lectures:
3 lectures break the _room stability_ constraint together
because two of them use a different room than the other one.

== Show me the API

OptaPlanner 7 provides all this information for you, through an API:

image::scoreVisualization.png[]

First build a `ScoreDirector` with `Solver.getScoreDirectorFactory()` and then

* Break down the score per constraint type with `ScoreDirector.getConstraintMatchTotals()`.
  Each `ConstraintMatchTotal` is one score rule. It holds it total score.
* Determine the score impact per planning entity with `ScoreDirector.getIndictmentMap()`.
  Each `Indictment` holds the total score impact of one planning entity.
  Use this to create a heat map.

== Conclusion

Help the user make sense of the resulting score.
Visualize which constraints and planning entities cause the most harm.
